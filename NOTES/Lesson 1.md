# Lesson 1
## Intro presentation

We learn how to get data and how to use said data in this course. 

Expected to learn: 
- Reproducibile data analysis
- Modern tools used by Data scientists

Example of analyzing data:
- Hypothesis could be that the Swedish stock market drops on friday
- Acquiring data can be done via an already existing datasource, such as Yahoo Finance. 
- Analyzing data can be done by finding all rows where the day is Friday, then calculate return from open to close $\frac{close - open}{open}$ and then finally visualize this result. 
- We finally draw a conclusion of the result and prove or disprove your hypothesis. 

High level we can say we do the following steps (not always a simple walk forward, sometimes we go in loops)
- Hypothesis -> Data retrieval -> Analysis -> Conclusion
