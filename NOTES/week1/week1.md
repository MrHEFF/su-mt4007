# Week 1
## Concepts
Installing the basic software, ie. Git/GitHub, MiniConda, Jupyter and some other extras merely for aesthetics such as Visual Studio Code. 

Explained what it means for an analysis to be correct:
1. Must output the correct output
2. Must be reproducible by others

### Forking
Make a copy of a repo by forking which is detached from the original repo. Compared to cloning which is still connected to the original repo. Forking a repository allows you to create your own version of a project you don't own. This is useful for making changes or building upon an existing project. However, be aware of the project's licensing. Forking open-source projects is generally acceptable, but doing so with proprietary code may constitute intellectual property theft.

### Cloning
When you want to make changes to a repository that you have ownership of and you want the changes to be reflected in the original repository, then you can clone the repository. For instance, if a new member joins a project, the new member can clone the project to get a hold of the code.

### Branches
Branching is simply said a copy of the main repo with some changes done to it but that don't affect the main repo.

- **Creating a branch** is done by using the "Current branch" tab in Git Desktop.

- **Deleting** is done by right clicking on any branch.

- **Merging** is done via the "Pull request" tab.
