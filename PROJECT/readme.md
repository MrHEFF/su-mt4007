# README for if you wish to run the code yourself. 
- In order to see the output of `main_report.html` or `main_report.ipynb` you can either run the html file in your default browser or open the repo in 
the editor of your choice and make a copy of the repo and then run everything by yourself.

- As mentioned in the report, if you wish to see the cleaning process of the original data see the folder `CLEANING`. 

## NOTES
There have been a lot of fails while using an older version of Python for whatever reason, everything from missing packages (despite being in the same dir) to not even wanting to run the code block and due to this I chose to go with a newer version, Python 3.12.3 as the kernel. See https://github.com/PackeTsar/Install-Python if you need to.
